# Introduction to the backend

The backend is essentially just an account server. It handles user accounts, syncing, and other account related features.

## Metrics

The backend exposes an endpoint for [Prometheus metrics](https://prometheus.io/) which allows you to keep track of the backend more easily, it can be accessed on `/metrics`.
To view these metrics properly, you'll need to use an analytics program like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), [which can visualize logs from Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/).

## Security

Optionally, there are a few security settings:

- [Recaptcha support](./configuration.mdx#captcha), the server can verify Recaptcha v3 tokens on register and login.
- [Ratelimits](./configuration.mdx#ratelimits), some expensive endpoints have ratelimits, but only when enabled. This requires an additional redis connection.

## Migrations

Migrations help keep your database schema in sync with everyone else. To run migrations, you can use the `pnpm migration:up` command inside the docker container or in your command-line if you're not using docker.

Alternatively, you can enable the [`postgres.migrateOnBoot`](./configuration.mdx#postgres-migrate-on-boot) variable and it will be automatically migrated on boot.
