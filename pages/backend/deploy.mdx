# Deploying the backend

The only officially recognized hosting method is through Docker (or similar container runtimes). It can be scaled horizontally to all your heart's content and is the safest way to host the backend.

For configuration, check out the [configuration reference](./configuration.mdx).

<Note>
The postgres database will need to be populated with [migrations](./introduction.mdx#migrations) if `postgres.migrateOnBoot` isn't enabled.
</Note>

## Method 1 - Docker Deployment

This method provides a straightforward setup with minimal configuration. For more extensive customization, see the [Configuration Reference](./configuration.mdx).

**Prerequisites**

* **Docker:** If you don't have Docker installed, download it from the official website: [Docker installation](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
* **Docker Compose:** Install Docker Compose following the instructions for your operating system: [Docker-Compose installation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

**Setup**
<Steps>
  <Steps.Step>
     **Create `docker-compose.yml`:**
     ```yaml
       version: '3.8'
       services:
         postgres:
           image: postgres
           environment:
             POSTGRES_USER: movie_web_user 
             POSTGRES_DB: movie_web_backend 
             POSTGRES_PASSWORD: YourPasswordHere 
           networks:
             - sudo-flix-network
         sudo-flix:
           image: ghcr.io/sussy-code/backend:latest
           environment:
             MWB_POSTGRES__CONNECTION: postgresql://movie_web_user:YourPasswordHere@postgres:5432/movie_web_backend
             MWB_CRYPTO__SESSION_SECRET: 32CharacterLongStringHere 
             MWB_META__NAME: unofficial-sudo-flix 
             MWB_POSTGRES__MIGRATE_ON_BOOT: "true"
             MIKRO_ORM_MIGRATIONS_DISABLE_FOREIGN_KEYS: "true" 
           ports:
             - "80:80"
           depends_on:
             - postgres
           networks:
             - sudo-flix-network
       networks:
         sudo-flix-network: 
           driver: bridge
    ```
      **Important:** 
       * Replace `YourPasswordHere` with your secure database password.
       * Generate a strong session secret and replace `32CharacterLongStringHere`.
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    **Start the Backend:**  Open a terminal in the directory containing `docker-compose.yml` and execute:

     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d 
     ```
  </Steps.Step>
</Steps>

### Accessing Your Backend

Your backend should be accessible on `(YourPrivateIP):80`. To share it outside your local network, you'll need to configure port forwarding or cloudflared tunnel. 

### Optional: Implementing a Reverse Proxy

To enhance your SSL and domain configuration, it's advisable to establish a reverse proxy, such as Nginx. For an optimal choice in this regard, Cloudflare Zero Trust Tunnel is recommended. You can find more information [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/).

- If you decide to utilize a reverse proxy, it's important to include `MWB_SERVER__CORS: "https://movie.example.com"` in your configuration.
  - `MWB_SERVER__CORS` must contain a **space-separated** list of origins (Protocol + Hostname) for the client to be able to access the backend.
- Depending on your specific setup, you may also require the addition of `MWB_SERVER__TRUST_PROXY: true` and `MWB_SERVER__TRUST_CLOUDFLARE: true`.

## Method 2 - Railway (Easy)

Railway offers you $5 of credit once you verify your account, which is enough to run the backend for around 5 months (~$0.90 per month).

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/hbgO43)

<Steps>
  <Steps.Step>
    Login to your [Railway](https://railway.app) account if you have one, otherwise create one [here](https://railway.app/login).
      - If you are signing up, then verify your account by clicking the link in the email Railway sends you.
      - If you created your account with an email, then to verify your account further, go to your account, then plans and verify your account with a GitHub account.
  </Steps.Step>
  
  <Steps.Step>
    Click the [`Deploy on Railway`](https://railway.app/template/TS4mw5) button above.
  </Steps.Step>
  
  <Steps.Step>
    If a `Configure` button is displayed, click on it and allow Railway to access your GitHub account. 
  </Steps.Step>
  
  <Steps.Step>
    Fill in the required variables or change the default values.
  </Steps.Step>
  
  <Steps.Step>
    The `Deploy` button at the bottom of the template should be active, click on it.
  </Steps.Step>
  
  <Steps.Step>
    Once the `Backend` service has deployed, copy the URL from the `Deployments` page. (Might take a second for it to be available after the service has deployed)
  </Steps.Step>
  
  <Steps.Step>
    Congratulations! You have deployed the backend, you can now [set up the client](../self-hosting/use-backend.mdx).
  </Steps.Step>
