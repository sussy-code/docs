# Deploying the proxy

## Method 1 - Netlify (Easy)

Netlify has a very generous free plan, so you'll be able to host your proxy for free unless you get hundreds of users.

<Steps>
   <Steps.Step>
     Create a GitHub account at https://github.com/signup if you don't have one already.
   </Steps.Step>

   <Steps.Step>
     Fork the [sudo-proxy repository](https://github.com/sussy-code/sudo-proxy) by clicking the `Fork` button in the top right corner. 
   </Steps.Step>


   <Steps.Step>
    Go to https://app.netlify.com/ and click `Sign Up` in the top right corner.
       - Authorize Netlify to connect with GitHub by clicking the `Connect to GitHub` button.
   </Steps.Step>

   <Steps.Step>
     Click on the `Add new site` button in the top right corner and select `Import an existing project` from the dropdown.
   </Steps.Step>

   <Steps.Step>
     Chose `GitHub` from the list and select the repository you forked. 
   </Steps.Step>

   <Steps.Step>
     Name your site and click `Deploy`.
   </Steps.Step>

   <Steps.Step>

   <Steps.Step>
     Click on the only site in the `Sites` section of your dashboard.
   </Steps.Step>

   <Steps.Step>
     Find the link of your site near the top of the page, it should look something like `https://<random-words>.netlify.app`. Right click the link, click `Copy link address`. [Now you'll just have to set up the client](../extra/streaming.mdx#method-1-self-hosted-proxy)!
   </Steps.Step>

## Method 4 - Docker

<Warning>
Experience with Docker, domains and web hosting is **highly recommended** for this method. <br />
[Deploying with Netlify](#method-1-netlify-easy) is easier and safer to do! You are exposing your server at your own risk!
</Warning>

Our `sudo-proxy` application is available from the GitHub Container Registry under the image [`ghcr.io/sussy-code/sudo-proxy:latest`](https://ghcr.io/sussy-code/sudo-proxy:latest)

The container exposes the HTTP port (Without TLS/SSL) as `3000/TCP`.

If you know what you are doing, you should know what to do with this information. If you don't, then please follow our Cloudflare guides.
